_**Hello World!**_

My name is Michael Lightfoot and I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Statistics at North Carolina State University. My main interests lie within the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially regarding their applications to various industries ranging from healthcare to observational astronomy!

This is my first blog so I hope you come along on this journey with me. I will mainly be discussing common statistical topics and questions, giving my two cents.

If you have any questions about:  
- my topics of discussion
- my current research
- my career path
    
Please shoot me an email!
