## Data Science vs Statisticians

Today I thought I would answer some common questions regarding what a data scientist is, and how I see myself personally within this industry.


**What do you think being a data scientist is about?**

I believe that a data scientist is someone who bridges the gap between statistics and software engineering. In a sense, a data scientist is an applied statistician.


**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**

You cannot be considered a data scientist without having both a strong theoretical statistics background, along with the software engineering skills needed to incorporate that statistics background.
A data scientist is tasked with augmenting the software engineering capabilities of a business via statistics. 

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**

Statisticians and data scientists both have a strong theoretical statistics background, but it is likely that the statistician is stronger in this facet of their work.
While the data scientists may possess less depth of statistical knowledge, they have much stronger software engineering backgrounds than the statisticians.
Generally, statisticians may perform theoretical research and have a thorough analysis on a certain statistical problem, while a data 
scientist builds statistical methods into the infrastructure of the business. 

**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**

Personally, I aspire to be a data scientist. At this point, I believe I don't have the caliber of skills needed in both statistics and software engineering to call myself a data scientist yet, but I will get there!


Thank you for reading!
