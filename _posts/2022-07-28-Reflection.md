Reflection about R
================

As my statistical programming course comes to an end this summer, I
would like to reflect on my experiences and discuss my thoughtd on R as
a programming language.

**What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science -
do you think you’ll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?**

I surely see myself using R in the future. I have grown to really
appreciate some of the packages available in R, namely caret and the
tidyverse. Aside from potential efficiency issues with it being an
interpretive language, R along with RStudio might be my favorite
approach to data science right now.

**What things are you going to do differently in practice now that
you’ve had this course?**

I definitely plan on incorporating shiny apps a bit more into my future
projects, as I believe they add an extra level of interactiveness for
whomever is learning about the project.

**What areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring
further?**

I would like to explore some methods not thoroughly discussed in this
course a bit more - namely deep learning methods. Many of the popular
machine learning use cases in industry currently have deep learning
methods as their champions, and I do not have a thorough theorectical
understanding of these methods yet.
