## Online News Popularity Project

Recently, I contributed to a project where we focused on an Online News Popularity Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a dataset which you can find [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity)

If you would like to take a look at the project, please find the github pages site [here](suproman98.github.io/project-2) and the associated repository [here](https://github.com/suproman98/project-2). I thought I would discuss some of my thoughts about this project.

**What would you do differently?**

If I were to contribute in a project like this again, I would spend a lot more time exploring different possible linear models with various main and interaction terms. The linear models seemed to perform well, so there is likely a combination of terms that we did not explore that would have performed better.

**What was the most difficult part for you?**

The most difficult part was likely the cooperation piece of this project - not because me and my group member worked poorly together by any means, but simply because different portions of this project had to be performed by different members in order for the project to progress, and that is always tricky to organize! Also, some of our models took a fair bit of time to run, which slowed down things as well.

**What are your big take-aways from this project?**

My biggest takeaway from this project is that there is always more customization and fine tuning that can be done to improve a model's performance. It is extremely unlikely that the first time you run a model will be the last time you will improve it!
