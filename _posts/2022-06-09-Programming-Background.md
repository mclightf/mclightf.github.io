## QnA

**What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software youâ€™ve used?
What functionality do you like about R?**

I think R is a perfect first language for a statistician. RStudio allows
you to get comfortable with markdown, and the plethora of output formats
is very convenient.

My favorite part about R is the ability to get the documentation for
anything you need right there in your RStudio via the ? command. I also
greatly appreciate the tidyverse and all of its simple and consistent
functionality.

**What parts do you miss about your other language?**

Python has simpler syntax in some places, but more annoying syntax in
others, so it is hard to say. I think Python is a bit more connected
with the computer science world than R is, which is a plus for Python.

**Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?**

I think R is one of the easiest languages to learn, up there with
Python. Of course, it has its challenges, but it has very
straightforward syntax and RStudio is one of the most useful tools for
any statistician.

## Example R Markdown Output

One super convenient capability of RStudio is its ability to coordinate
with GitHub via the projects! For instance, this whole post was done in
RStudio. Here is a plot to show that off!

``` r
plot(iris)
```
